        Software Solutions for a Better Life 
        <div id="intro_content">
          In an attempt to streamline and scale the process of assisting and guiding customers through their individual software packages I came up with the concept of a customer software services guide (or simply customer guide). I achieved this by creating several dedicated sites for many of my company's services and product offerings. On top of that, I created a referral system designed to not only increase sales but also retention rates.

            As the company increased the number of services it marketed a natural and inevitable dilemma had taken place, disorganization. The newer services were being heavily marketed while the older ones got lost in the background. I wanted to create a way for customers (and prospective customers) to fully understand what we had to offer with a focus on a better user experience than what was currently available The intention of this page was to help generate a structured environment to which a user could refer to and explore for a better understanding their software package and/or to eventually upgrade to one

        <div id="content2">
          <p>
            To ease the experience for new customers, I created pages designed to give instruction on how our services worked as well as how it would benefit them. In all of the tutorial pages I opted for both a consistent and simplistic layout to give users a clear understanding as to their purpose and intention.

            In marketing and sales it is a well know fact that the best advertising of a product or service is done through the mouths of your own customer base. Better than any third-party technique, the credibility of one's social circle trumps all others. Knowing this I constructed a referral system to help increase our sales. It began with incentivizing feedback from our customer base by offering a quick entertaining video (a battle between the company's President and a bull styled in the form of a videogame) in exchange for responses to a few questions.

            The best strategy to reach the point of closing a sale is one that involves piquing a visitor's interest. For my referral site, this was accomplished by placing a tab within the navigation area leading visitors to a form where they could sign up to receive even more rewards when they refer someone. Visitors who did not currently possess our premium package would see this simple form to which at the very least would cause them to seek out more information about this package, mission accomplished.

            With any company the only thing better than obtaining new customers is retaining them. My referral system provided added incentive for customers who owned our premium software package to stay active, this was achieved in two ways. First, along with the incentives already built into the company (i.e. shopping credits) I offered them a trip to Cancun via a vacation voucher ($600 value). Second, I also offered people who were referred by those customers a trip to Cancun as well without having to purchase our premium package. I made sure to include instructional pages to make clear all the necessary details.

            Here is the the referral page which gives the company its best chance at obtaining a high quality customer base. I've also taken the liberty to outline in detail the many ways our services could benefit those whom our customers understand better than we do. It's also a great way to advertise to customers in an attempt to lead them towards the acquisition of another sale.

            This is where it all leads up to. This page is where customers can get a detailed view of what each software package has to offer, including what comes free for simply signing up. At this point a customer would have had plenty of exposure to the different services enough to see the value in upgrading. I placed a carousel style photo gallery towards the beginning of the page so visitors could see what custom package options were available. I also placed a button at the bottom of the page leading visitors to the company's main website to upgrade with an option to view a video further detailing our features (Hub Tour).
