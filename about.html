					To start off, the team and I begin the process of conceptualizing a product or service. We evaluate cost (for things like marketing, technology usage, etc.) and discuss future deadlines and cycle release dates. Finally, we overview and assess the technologies that will be necessary to work most efficiently towards deployment.
				</div>

				<div class="workflow_header" style="color:#FF4B43">Design</div>
				<div class="workflow_content">
					Here is where our abstract ideas become more concrete. The process involves turning organized notes into the final draft of a sketch. From there I do research for creative inspiration to gain a sense of direction for the product's overall design. I then take our sketches along with researched concepts and create a wireframe for the product's interface. Subsequently, I begin the process of rapid prototyping. Finally, the team analyzes and suggests any design changes that could help improve the product before it goes into development.
				</div>

				<div class="workflow_header" style="color:#FF2B06">Develop</div>
				<div class="workflow_content">
					At this stage, I put aside all design plans and begin working along the backend. I organize and outline all of the entities and resources of the product, using a UML-like format, that will be necessary to eventually create a software prototype. From there, I begin writing high level tests using Rspec followed by an iteration of the code that passes the tests until a particular feature is in place. Once a rough base of the backend is in order, I begin implementing the design for the product's interface while working in-house to test for user experience. The overall procedure is one that's about 70% technical and 30% non-technical involving brief team meetings and discussions regarding potential conceptual and design changes. Using this Agile-like approach I must work in an adaptive and flexible manner with the ability to rapidly respond to modification requests.

				<div class="workflow_content">
					This is where all of the work pays off! The point in which marketing meets product as we approach the finish line towards deployment. Before doing so, I'll make the necessary adjustments to the app's configuration setup and add any gems that will be used within the production environment (such as paperclip and postgreSQL). Finally, I will deploy the code to production to be run and user tested in Beta for user feedback to help improve the product or service within its early stages. Beyond this point, I will work to maintain and iteratively improve the product over time upon company requests.
