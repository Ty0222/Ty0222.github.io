						Several years after owning my beloved Dodge Avenger, nature's elements really began to take a toll on the look of my vehicle. The paint began to peel and crack along the front bumper as its top layer was stripping away. I needed a paint job badly! I got a few estimates from shops in my area. It became clear to me that this job would not be a cheap one just as I had feared. I was going to have to just suck it up and fork over the $500+ to reserve my time slot. But the more I thought about it the more I grew frustrated about the whole situation. Although I cherished my car, I thought there just had to be a better alternative use of my money. <br/><br/>

						I eventually stumbled upon the concept of "vinyl wrapping". A superficial design technique used to enhance the look of a vehicle typically with the use of 3M vinyl wrapping paper. I took an interest to this idea, but the labor costs were just too steep for my liking. Then it hit me! "Why don't I just skip the middleman altogether, buy the material myself, and learn to do whatever these shops would have done to redesign the look of my car?", I said to myself. My mind was set, I was going to tackle this challenge head first. Call me stubborn I guess. <br/><br/>

						I immediately began combing through hours of Youtube tutorials for the best techniques, and within a week's time, I was ready to begin wrapping. I purchased some vinyl kits that fit well with my car and added a few custom design concepts inspired by some of my favorite exotic cars, such as the Lamborghini Aventador. I bought all the of tools the pros used to get the job done such as a squeegee, 30-degree angle blades along with knifeless tape (a life saver) for max cutting precision, measuring tape, and most importantly a heat gun for sealing the vinyl edges. In less than a month, I had completely finished the redesign with the added touch of some plastic molds and LED lights right below the grill just for that extra edge to the overall look. <br/><br/>

						To say I knew it would turn out to be a success would be a lie, but if you never try you'll never know what you're capable of. So below are some comparison photos of a standard Avenger versus my redesign. It's not perfect, but I hope that if you're a fan of cars or even just of taking on new challenges in general that you'll appreciate it. Thanks for reading!
